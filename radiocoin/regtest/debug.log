2021-05-26T23:16:03Z Warning: relative datadir option './' specified, which will be interpreted relative to the current working directory '/home/c4pt/opt/COIN/radiocoin/radioCOIN'. This is fragile, because if radiocoin is started in the future from a different location, it will be unable to locate the current data files. There could also be data loss if radiocoin is started while in a temporary directory.
