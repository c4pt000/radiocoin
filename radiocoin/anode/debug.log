2021-05-27T09:24:26Z RadioCoin Core version v0.18.1.0-f43983e-dirty (release build)
2021-05-27T09:24:26Z Validating signatures for all blocks.
2021-05-27T09:24:26Z Setting nMinimumChainWork=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002ee655bf00bf13b4cca
2021-05-27T09:24:26Z Using the 'sse4(1way),sse41(4way),avx2(8way)' SHA256 implementation
2021-05-27T09:24:26Z Using RdRand as an additional entropy source

2021-05-27T09:24:26Z Config file: /home/c4pt/opt/CURRENTRADIO/radioCOIN/radiocoin/./anode/radiocoin.conf (not found, skipping)
2021-05-27T09:24:26Z Using at most 125 automatic connections (1024 file descriptors available)
2021-05-27T09:24:26Z Warning: relative datadir option './anode' specified, which will be interpreted relative to the current working directory '/home/c4pt/opt/CURRENTRADIO/radioCOIN/radiocoin'. This is fragile, because if radiocoin is started in the future from a different location, it will be unable to locate the current data files. There could also be data loss if radiocoin is started while in a temporary directory.
